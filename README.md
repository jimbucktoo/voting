# voting

Voting is a decentralized voting web application that allows users to securely cast and view votes on the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask and smart contracts built with Solidity.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jimbucktoo/voting.git
cd voting
```

### 2. Run a local server

Using Python 3â€™s built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Technologies

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - Solidity is a programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) - The ethers.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a user to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
